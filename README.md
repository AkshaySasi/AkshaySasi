## 🔭 About Me

I’m an AI Engineer currently working at **Storygame (P) Ltd**, blending creativity with code to develop cutting-edge GenAI and NLP-based products. From model fine-tuning and inference to lip-sync generation and AI agents, I thrive at the intersection of research and rapid prototyping.

Previously, I interned at **Quest Global** and **AI Chip Center** at Digital University Kerala, working across predictive modeling, processor architecture, and compiler design.

I'm passionate about meaningful tech—be it legal AI tools, mental health agents, or audio branding generators.
