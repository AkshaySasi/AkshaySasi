🚀 **About Me**  
I’m an AI Engineer with a deep curiosity for how intelligence can be built, enhanced, and creatively applied.  
From engineering in Kannur to AI research in Trivandrum — my journey has taken me from **frontend code** to **neural networks**, and from **hackathons** to **AI-powered storytelling**.

I'm passionate about building impactful, real-world applications — whether it's an **LLM-powered legal assistant**, an **AI-based health twin**, or a **creative jingle generator** using generative audio models.
