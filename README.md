## 🔭 About Me

I’m someone who genuinely loves working in tech — especially when it involves building smart systems.

Right now, I’m working as an AI Engineer at a startup, where I get to turn ideas into real things. Most of my time goes into experimenting with AI tools, fine-tuning models, deploying them, and figuring out how to make them work better in real-world scenarios.

Some areas I really enjoy:
• Building AI agents
• Model fine-tuning and inference
• Prototyping AI-powered ideas
• Automating things using AI
• Exploring how self-learning systems can be built

I like working on projects that teach me something new, push me to think harder, and actually help people in some way. Still learning — and that’s what keeps it exciting.
